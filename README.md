I am the Executive Assistant to the Head of the Menshikov Palace Department at The State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, Russia.

Since 2012, I have been involved in both scientific research and administrative roles at the Hermitage. I deliver lectures, lead exclusive "behind-the-scenes" tours, and organize events. Additionally, I write custom tours and scripts for audio guides for various companies and projects.

I began learning Python in 2022. What started as a hobby has since complemented my main work and even turned into a source of income.

Instead of working on pet projects, I found myself developing commercial solutions for a friend’s company, *Peshekhod Tour*, one of the leaders in the walking tours market in St. Petersburg. They had a problem: tourists kept asking the same questions. So, I developed a [Telegram bot assistant](https://t.me/peshehod_help_bot) to solve this by answering FAQs, providing tour info, and helping users choose a tour via a quiz, freeing up the managers. Code and specs are [here](https://github.com/tropintropin/telegram_bot_peshehod_chat).

Since late 2024, I have been working with *Peshekhod Tour* on a project to develop a bot for city-wide audio guides in a city located above the Arctic Circle in Russia. It turned out that both my expertise in creating tourist routes and writing tours, and my programming skills, were in demand for this project.
