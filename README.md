_Someday there will be a more detailed description, but for now ..._

Iâ€™m currently working in The State Hermitage Museum, the Menshikov Palace Department, Saint Petersurg, Russia as an assistant department manager.

I am currently learning Python + JavaScript in order to find a new job. It would be great if in my new job I could combine work in culture and IT.
